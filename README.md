## Features

- Template for new Python 3 projects.
- Installable using [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/).
    > `pip` is the package installer for Python. You can use `pip` to install packages from the Python Package Index and other indexes.
- Suitable for uploading uploading a package to the public listing on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/).

But it does use these:

- Uses Makefile
- Formatting, linting, type checks and unit tests
- GH Actions CI flow
